# Spec: Oracle Core

Port of Accordant's `Spec<TState>` / `Expect` DSL / `Allows` oracle to a pure Scala 3
kernel. This is the foundational capability: every other spec in this change consumes
the types introduced here.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Operation registration and lookup

The system SHALL register each `Operation` under its `OperationName` and dispatch `allows` through the typed operation handle without casts; duplicate names MUST be rejected rather than silently overridden.

**Given** an empty `Spec[S]`
**When** an `Operation[Req, Res, S]` is registered
**Then** the spec exposes it under its `OperationName`, and `allows` invoked with the typed operation handle dispatches to its behaviour without casts

**Rationale**: Accordant registers operations by name with runtime-typed lambdas; the port keeps the name (for reports/persistence) but dispatches through the typed handle so `Req`/`Res` mismatches are compile errors.

#### Scenario: Happy path — registered operation dispatches

**Given** a spec with the `Withdraw` operation registered
**When** `spec.allows(withdraw, WithdrawRequest("alice", 30), res, profile)` is called with a response `res` that satisfies `Withdraw`'s declared check
**Then** the verdict is computed from `Withdraw`'s behaviour lambda

#### Scenario: Error path — unknown operation

**Given** a spec where `Withdraw` was never registered
**When** `allows` is invoked with the unregistered `Withdraw` handle
**Then** the verdict is `Deviant(NonEmptyList.one(UnknownOperation("Withdraw")))`

#### Scenario: Edge case — duplicate registration

**Given** a spec with `Withdraw` registered
**When** a second operation with name `Withdraw` is registered
**Then** registration is rejected (`Either.Left`) — silent override is unrepresentable

### Requirement: Outcome evaluation with accumulated violations

The oracle SHALL evaluate each actual response against every candidate state, applying the `Same`/`Next` transition when the check passes, and MUST accumulate ALL check violations (never only the first) when it fails.

**Given** an operation whose behaviour returns `Same(check)` or `Next(check, transition)`
**When** the oracle evaluates an actual response against a candidate state
**Then** if the check validates, the candidate's next state is the unchanged state (`Same`) or `transition(response, state)` (`Next`); if it fails, ALL violations from the check are accumulated (not just the first)

**Rationale**: `ValidatedNel` error accumulation is the designed upgrade over .NET's single boolean+message (report §3.2, §5).

#### Scenario: Happy path — Next transition applies response-dependent state

**Given** state where `alice` has balance 50, and `Deposit`'s outcome is `Next(check, (res, s) => s.copy(accounts = s.accounts.updated("alice", res.newBalance)))`
**When** the oracle evaluates a response with `newBalance = 80`
**Then** the verdict is `Conformant` with the surviving state showing `alice → 80` (the value came from the response, mirroring Accordant tutorial 03)

#### Scenario: Error path — multiple check failures accumulate

**Given** a check asserting both `r.isSuccess` and `r.balance == 20`
**When** the response is a failure with balance 99
**Then** the `Deviant` verdict carries BOTH violations in its `NonEmptyList`

#### Scenario: Edge case — Same outcome leaves profile untouched

**Given** any profile and an outcome `Same(check)` whose check passes
**When** the oracle evaluates
**Then** the surviving profile is `Eq`-equal to the input profile

### Requirement: Non-deterministic outcomes and state-profile branching

For an `OneOf` outcome, the oracle SHALL produce the `Eq`-deduplicated union of the next-states of every branch whose check passes across every candidate state, and MUST return `Deviant` only when no branch passes for any candidate.

**Given** an operation returning `OneOf(branches)` (e.g. timeout: request lost / request applied but response lost)
**When** `allows` evaluates a response against a profile
**Then** the resulting profile is the `Eq`-deduplicated union of next-states of every branch whose check passes, across every candidate state; the verdict is `Deviant` only if NO branch passes for ANY candidate

**Rationale**: This is Accordant's indefinite-failure model (how-to: indefinite-failures): a timeout on `CreateAccount("alice")` leaves a profile of two worlds; a later successful `GetAccount("alice")` collapses it to one.

#### Scenario: Happy path — timeout forks the profile

**Given** a single-state profile and `CreateAccount` whose outcome is `OneOf(success→Next, timeout→Same, timeout→Next)`
**When** the actual response is a timeout
**Then** the verdict is `Conformant` with a two-state profile: one without `alice`, one with `alice → 0`

#### Scenario: Happy path — later observation collapses the profile

**Given** the two-state profile above and `GetAccount("alice")` specced as `OneOf(found if alice ∈ accounts → Same, notFound if alice ∉ accounts → Same)`
**When** the actual response is `found(balance = 0)`
**Then** the verdict is `Conformant` with exactly the single state where `alice` exists

#### Scenario: Error path — profile exhausted

**Given** the two-state profile and a `GetAccount("alice")` response of `found(balance = 999)`
**When** `allows` evaluates
**Then** the verdict is `Deviant`, accumulating the failed `CheckFailed` atoms from every branch that rejected the response across both candidate worlds (`NoBranchMatched`/`ProfileExhausted` remain reserved for richer per-candidate reports and the totality fallback respectively)

### Requirement: StateProfile invariants

A `StateProfile` MUST never be empty and MUST never contain two `Eq`-equal states, across any sequence of construction, forking, and collapse.

**Given** any sequence of oracle evaluations
**When** profiles are constructed, forked, and collapsed
**Then** a profile is never empty and never contains two `Eq`-equal states

#### Scenario: Edge case — duplicate next-states collapse

**Given** two `OneOf` branches whose transitions produce `Eq`-equal states
**When** both branches match
**Then** the surviving profile contains that state exactly once

## Properties (Ring 3)

### Property: Conformant ⇔ some branch matches some candidate

**Generator strategy** (Hedgehog): constructive `genBankState` (a `Map` from `Gen.string(Gen.alpha, Range.linear(1, 8))` keys and `BigDecimal` balances over `Range.linear`), `genStateProfile` = deduplicated `NonEmptyList` of 1–4 states (size via `Range.linear(1, 4)`, covering the single-state edge), `genWithdrawRequest` over known and unknown account ids, `genWithdrawResponse` via `Gen.frequency1` across ALL variants (success/notFound/badRequest/timeout). No `.ensure`-filtering; classify on match/no-match (integrated shrinking)

**Invariant**: `allows` returns `Conformant` iff at least one (candidate state × outcome branch) pair has a passing check; the surviving profile equals the deduplicated set of corresponding next-states.

```
property("Conformant iff some branch matches some candidate") {
  for {
    profile <- genStateProfile.forAll
    req     <- genWithdrawRequest.forAll
    res     <- genWithdrawResponse.forAll
  } yield {
    val expected = profile.toList
      .flatMap(s => matchingBranches(withdraw.behaviour(req, s), res, s).map(_.nextState(res, s)))
      .distinctByEq
    spec.allows(withdraw, req, res, profile) match
      case Conformant(p) => Result.assert(expected.nonEmpty && p.toList.sameElementsByEq(expected))
      case Deviant(_)    => Result.assert(expected.isEmpty)
  }
}
```

### Property: Same preserves the profile

**Generator strategy** (Hedgehog): `genStateProfile` as above + constructive `genGetAccountRequest`; the response is drawn from the operation's own `mock` generator so the check passes by construction

**Invariant**: For operations whose outcome is `Same` with an always-passing check, the output profile is `Eq`-equal to the input profile, for all profiles and requests.

```
property("Same preserves the profile") {
  for {
    profile <- genStateProfile.forAll
    req     <- genGetAccountRequest.forAll
  } yield assertEquals(spec.allows(noopGet, req, anyRes, profile), Conformant(profile))
}
```

### Property: Deviant accumulates every failed check

**Generator strategy** (Hedgehog): `genWithdrawResponse` biased via `Gen.frequency1` toward check-failing variants; classify reports the deviant/conformant split so the failure path is visibly exercised

**Invariant**: When no branch matches, the violation list size equals the total number of failed atomic checks across all branches and candidates — never 1 unless there was exactly one check.

```
property("Deviant accumulates every failed check") {
  for {
    profile <- genStateProfile.forAll
    res     <- genWithdrawResponse.forAll
  } yield spec.allows(multiCheckOp, req, res, profile) match
    case Deviant(vs)   => assertEquals(vs.length, countFailedChecks(multiCheckOp, res, profile))
    case Conformant(_) => Result.success
}
```

### Property: Profile dedup is idempotent and order-insensitive

**Generator strategy** (Hedgehog): `Gen.element1` of 3 fixed `BankState`s, collected via `.list(Range.linear(1, 12))` and wrapped as a `NonEmptyList`, so duplicate collisions are forced constructively

**Invariant**: `StateProfile.of(xs) == StateProfile.of(xs.reverse)` and constructing from a list with duplicates equals constructing from its distinct elements.

```
property("Profile dedup is idempotent and order-insensitive") {
  for {
    states <- genNelBankState.forAll
  } yield Result.assert(
    StateProfile.of(states) === StateProfile.of(states.reverse) &&
    StateProfile.of(states ::: states) === StateProfile.of(states)
  )
}
```

## Compile-Negative Obligations

| Must NOT compile | Why | Test |
|---|---|---|
| `OperationName("")` / `CallLabel("")` (literals) | Iron `Not[Blank]` rejects blank literals at compile time; dynamic strings go through `OperationName.either` | `assertDoesNotCompile` stub in the typed contract |
| `spec.allows(withdraw, DepositRequest(...), res, profile)` | typed operation handles make Req/Res mismatches type errors — the "no casts" claim is type-level | `assertDoesNotCompile` stub |
| `StateProfile.of(List.empty)` | no public constructor from a possibly-empty collection; only `NonEmptyList`/`one` entry points — emptiness is unrepresentable, not validated | `assertDoesNotCompile` stub |

## Formal Contracts (Ring 6)

`engine.verified.OutcomeEval` and `engine.verified.ProfileEval` are PureScala-subset
(no Gen, no fs2, only List/Option/Either):

```
def survivors(branches: List[Branch], res: Res, candidates: List[S]): List[S] = {
  require(candidates.nonEmpty)
  ...
} ensuring (out =>
  out.forall(s => candidates.exists(c => branches.exists(b => b.matches(res, c) && b.next(res, c) == s)))
  && noDuplicates(out)
)

def verdict(survivors: List[S], violations: List[SpecViolation]): Verdict = {
  ...
} ensuring (v => (survivors.nonEmpty == v.isConformant) && (survivors.isEmpty ==> violations.nonEmpty))
```
